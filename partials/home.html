                <p>No money, we have no way to live a good life, no money, our lives will become bleak and decadent. What is money? Is the remuneration of the workers, is the operator's effort, but also millions of people living umbrella. There is a song to sing, "money that, you are a knife to kill the blood" "". Is that right? I do not think so, the real killer of the knife is desire and greed. Money, in fact, is a matter of light, it is not as bad as the wicked, nor as the prisoners say "is the money to force them into prison." It is really important to look at the value of money correctly. Although money is not a panacea, but the days of no money are hard. No money there is no romantic encounter, no money can not develop their own business, although there are many self-made rich, but they also rely on the usual accumulation and slowly into the ranks of the rich.</p>

                <h2>Article 2</h2>

                <p>Money is not guilty, sin comes from evil beliefs, sin from moral decay, sin from the withering of life, from the ideological degradation and insensitivity. Lonely life of the road, melancholy is the money, feeling is for the money, but when the money to you I waved, we may have a good grasp, and strive to fight, maybe not, maybe we worked hard, but this can be encountered Unsuitable time is always fleeting, invisible also touched, leaving only the open lonely, a touch of sadness. Do not have to regret for those, do not lose because of their own under the negative decision, life will always stay in the process of waiting, waiting for you to restore the will, the whole move forward. The value of money lies in the proper application, reasonable domination, timely use, prudent investment and agile harvest. Businessmen have money, they can use money to nurture money, money to create value for the community, you can make their money in a certain sense become more valuable, and we ordinary people will only deposit money into the bank, enjoy Is the meager interest, we will not use our hard earned money to stocks, not dare to use our hard money to buy futures, but do not dare to use their own money to invest ..... because we do not understand the value of this world Change, and repeatedly, our money has become the investment costs of businessmen and businessmen, they can use loans to build their own siege for the heart, rippling business, floating precipitation, accumulation of wealth.</p>

            <p>The value of money, is that we can not say that no one does not love to make money, and no one will give up because of money to make money, because only the use of their own hands of money, our lives may be hovering and value-added, this Is the essence of money, have money to make money become valuable, like businessmen to use money to return to the community to create the quality of service to the community, with the eyes of businessmen to look at the value of money. But most of us will only let the money led away, because we too much value earned with their own hands, of course, do not want to exaggerate the move, for fear of their own shot, no money trace, for fear of their own Bold scare away the laws of the market. We do not have that courage, no that frank, there is no that courage. So we are always around the surrounding environment, quietly by the hard work to bring the emotions!</p>
